    "## Analyzing Rental Property Capitalization Rates and Venues by Neighborhood of Selected Regions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "(Web-Scraping, Foursquare API, Folium Map, Kmeans Clustering & Machine Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will analyze housing and rent prices of multiple neighborhood in the Great Boston area of Massachusetts.  We will make a comparison that is data driven to help investors gain insight in a manner of relative evaluation at the neighborhoods level.  We will calculate rental capitalization rates (cap rates) by taking the by-neighborhood average of recently sold homes prices and recently rented rent prices.  We will also look to develop an indicator of neighborhood rental desirability that is measured by the neighborhood's available venues within its close proximity.  Regression analysis of cap rates and clustered neighbors segmented by venue types and quantity will also be explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods that will be used: \n",
    "\n",
    "We will convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods of selected regions. We'll use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. The k-means clustering algorithm will be used to complete this task. Finally, we'll the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods and their emerging clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent MLS data of rental and home sale price will be used to extrapolate capitalization rates by neighborhoods.  We will extract this data directly from MLS data base and import to a pandas data frame for analysis. (Another option would be to scrape data from Website such as Zillow or Redfin. We will decide on which is the better method as we approach this segment of the analysis.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is formatted into a proper structure, we will explore and cluster various neighborhoods.  Ultimately we will create a mapping visualization tool to help bringing insight to investors whom would be interested in acquiring rental property, purhaps of an unfamiliar region to them.  Folium will again be used to map cap rates and venues availability.  Cap rates will be the measure of profitability and Venues as comparison of neighborhood types and indicator of desirability by potential tenants.  That is, the more the venues that are accessible the more desirable a neighborhood to reside within.  We will also provide some regression analysis comparing neighborhood cap rates vs clustered neighborhood types to see if correlations exists.\n",
